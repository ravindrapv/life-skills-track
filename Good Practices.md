# Good Practices for Software Development

## Summary

This document summarizes six good practices for software development:

1. Gathering requirements
2. Over-communicating
3. Asking questions when stuck
4. Getting to know your teammates
5. Being aware of other team members
6. Being fully involved in your work

## Detailed Practices

### 1. Gathering requirements

When gathering requirements, it is important to take notes so that you can remember the important details and identify any areas of confusion. You should also ask clarifying questions to ensure that you fully understand the requirements.

### 2. Over-communicating

It is always better to over-communicate than to under-communicate. This means using group chat or channels to communicate with your team, rather than private DMs. It also means keeping your team members updated on your progress and any changes to the requirements or plans.

### 3. Asking questions when stuck

If you get stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. Clearly explain the problem to your team members and mention the solutions you have already tried. Be sure to also provide as much context as possible, such as the code that is causing the problem and the steps you have taken to try to fix it.

### 4. Getting to know your teammates

It is important to get to know your teammates personally. This will help to build trust and communication, which is essential for successful teamwork. You can get to know your teammates by attending team meetings, participating in social events, and simply chatting with them one-on-one.

### 5. Being aware of other team members

When you are working on a team, it is important to be aware of other team members' needs and schedules. Be responsive to messages and emails, and try to be available for real-time conversations whenever possible. It is also important to be respectful of other people's time and to avoid making unnecessary requests.

### 6. Being fully involved in your work

When you are at work, it is important to minimize distractions and focus on your work. This means turning off your phone, closing unnecessary tabs on your computer, and finding a quiet place to work. It is also important to take breaks throughout the day to avoid burnout.

## Area for Improvement

I need to improve my ability to ask good questions. This means taking the time to understand the problem clearly, researching potential solutions before asking for help, and being open to feedback.

## Ideas for Improvement

* Before asking for help, I will try to understand the problem well and research potential solutions.
* I will ask seniors for feedback on my questions.
* Instead of trying to find solutions on my own for a long time, I will ask for help from my teammates.

I am committed to improving my skills and becoming a better software developer. I believe that by following the good practices outlined in this document, I can make a significant contribution to my team and to the projects that I work on.
