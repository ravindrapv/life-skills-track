## How to learn Software Concepts

- Where is this concept used or applied?
- What is the concept? Can I explain it to someone in my own words?
- How can I implement it in code or design?
When do I need to complete the practice drills or assignment or project for this topic?
  
  Few points to keep in mind:
  - The deadlines are only a tool for you to allocate certain time for the topics.
  - Focus on the concept. Approach it with curiosity and joy.
  - Make the process of learning fun and easy for you.
  - Make the concept your own. Your own words, your way of understanding it, your own code.
  - You know a concept well when you can teach it. If someone wakes you up at 2 am in the night for some software issue, you can easily fix it and go to sleep.
